## Cyber Security Internship - Task 1

### Overview
This repository documents the tasks completed during my Cyber Security internship. The focus of this task was on identifying and exploiting web application vulnerabilities using Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) and Burp Suite.

### Tasks Completed
1. **SQL Injection**
   - Explored SQL injection vulnerabilities to manipulate database queries.
   - Extracted sensitive information, including user credentials.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - Identified and exploited both reflected and stored XSS vulnerabilities.
   - Demonstrated how malicious scripts can compromise user sessions.

3. **Authentication Flaws**
   - Analyzed authentication mechanisms for weaknesses.
   - Highlighted issues such as insecure password storage and session management.

### Tools Used
- **Burp Suite**: For intercepting and modifying web requests.
- **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)**: A platform for practicing web security testing.

### Conclusion
This task has significantly enhanced my understanding of web vulnerabilities and the importance of implementing robust security measures. I look forward to applying these skills in future tasks and projects.
